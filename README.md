# 🕹️ Assignment Project

## 📖 Overview
**Project** is a distributed Node.js + TypeScript project designed with a **microservices architecture**.  
It comprises two main services:

- **API Service:** Provides REST endpoints for player and gameplay operations.
- **Worker Service:** Consumes background jobs and processes them asynchronously.

The system integrates **RabbitMQ** for message queuing, **Redis** for caching and inter-service communication, and a **database** MongoDB  for persistent storage.
